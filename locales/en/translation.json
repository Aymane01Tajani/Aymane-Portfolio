To guarantee performance and availability, we implement: A Load Balancer, to intelligently distribute the load between multiple application servers hosted on the front end. Scalable clusters dedicated to storing media downloaded by customers, ensuring dynamic scalability and real-time protection against data loss. This architecture guarantees resilience, scalability, and high availability to provide a smooth experience, even under high demand.",

The architecture is divided into three main layers: Frontend, Services, and Database.</p><ul><li><strong>Mobile Frontend:</strong> This layer corresponds to the user interface, developed with the Flutter framework and the Dart language. It is designed to work on mobile devices and web browsers, providing a seamless, cross-platform user experience. Users interact with the application through this interface to perform actions such as clocking in or managing their data.</li><li><strong>Services:</strong> This layer groups together the backend services required for the application to function properly. Implemented services include:<br />- Authentication Service: Based on Firebase Authentication, it enables secure user login management.</li><li><strong>Time and Attendance Services:</strong> These include features such as facial recognition (via ML Kit), geolocation (via Google Maps API), and QR code scanning (Flutter QR Code integration). These services are interconnected to ensure flexible time and attendance options tailored to user needs.</li><li><strong>Database:</strong> Data persistence is ensured by Firebase Firestore, a powerful and scalable NoSQL database. It stores user information, roles, and time and attendance history, while ensuring real-time synchronization with the application.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The arrows in the diagram represent the communication flows between the different layers. The frontend communicates with services via HTTP requests (REST API) or Firebase SDKs, while services interact with the database to perform read and write operations. This organization ensures a modular architecture, where each layer can evolve independently to meet the future needs of the application.</p>",

In the case of the E-games application, the \"Game\" model is used to store information about the games available for purchase, such as name, price, console, etc. The \"User\" model is used to manage registered user information, such as first and last name, email address, etc. The \"Purchase\" model stores the details of each purchase made, such as the user, the game purchased, the price, the date, etc.</p></div><div class=\"tech-detail\"><h4><i class=\"fas fa-cog\"></i> Views</h4><p>Views manage the application logic and define how data is presented to users. In the E-games application, different views are developed, such as the homepage view, the game list view, the game details view, the store availability view, the registration form view, and the purchase confirmation view. Each view retrieves the necessary data from the models, performs the appropriate processing, and returns the results to the templates.</p></div><div class=\"tech-detail\"><h4><i class=\"fas fa-palette\"></i> Templates</h4><p>Templates are responsible for displaying data and the visual presentation of the application. In the E-games application, corresponding templates are developed for each view. For example, there is a template for the home page, another for the game list, another for game details, and so on. Templates use tags and variables to display dynamic data from the views. They also help organize the structure and style of the user interface.</p></div><p><strong>The MVT architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns by isolating the application's business logic, presentation, and data.
